## 🚀 About me

👋 Hello! I'm Vinícius Martins.

🎓 I graduated in Electromechanics from the Federal Institute of Paraná, where I developed projects focused on development during my studies, such as Home Automation for my thesis and an augmented reality sandbox as a course project.

📚 I am currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at PUCPR.

🪖 I dedicated one year of my career to community service in the Brazilian Army, where I earned the honors of Most Distinguished Soldier and Merit Honor.

💻 I am currently working as a Software Developer at VEXUR.
